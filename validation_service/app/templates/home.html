<h1>HBP Model Validation Service</h1>

<p>This is an early-stage prototype service for validation of neuroscience models.</p>

<p>It consists of:</p>
<ul>
    <li>a <a href="/view/models/">model catalog</a></li>
    <li>a <a href="/view/tests/">library of validation test definitions</a>, using the <a href="http://scidash.github.io" target="_blank">SciUnit</a> framework.</li>
    <li>a <a href="/view/results/">database of validation test results</a></li>
</ul>

<p>At present, the web interface offers limited functionality for browsing models, tests and results.
In the near future, it will become possible to add new models and tests.</p>

<p>There is an <a href="https://github.com/apdavison/hbp-validation-client" target="_blank">associated Python library</a>,
which allows you to run validation tests on your own local computer and automatically register the results
with the Validation Service.</p>

<p>[<a href="https://github.com/apdavison/hbp-validation-framework" target="_blank">Source code for this service.</a>]</p>
